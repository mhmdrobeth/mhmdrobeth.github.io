abstract: Ggplot2 is one of the most popular data visualization packages in R, designed to create elegant, consistent, and flexible graphics. This package is based on the "Grammar of Graphics" concept, which allows users to build visualizations by layering various elements. ggplot2 is particularly useful for data exploration as well as professional visual reporting. The basic structure of ggplot2 consists of three main components data, aesthetic mapping (aes), and geometries (geom). Data is the dataset serving as the foundation of the visualization. Aesthetic mapping maps variables in the dataset to visual elements such as axes, color, size, or shape. Geometries define the type of chart, such as points (scatter plots), bars (bar charts), or lines (line charts).
